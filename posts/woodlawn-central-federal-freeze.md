# Abundance Agenda

## Woodlawn Central Targets August Groundbreaking

The first phase of [Woodlawn Central](https://woodlawncentral.com/), the ambitious mixed-use development led by Apostolic Church of God, is on track for a [summer groundbreaking](https://chicago.suntimes.com/real-estate/2026/01/23/woodlawn-apostolic-church-brazier-groundbreaking-cultural-hub-housing-retail) if it clears remaining approvals. Developer J. Byron Brazier expects the project to appear before the Plan Commission in March, with City Council consideration to follow.

The [first phase](https://blockclubchicago.org/2026/01/12/woodlawn-central-developers-seek-city-approval-to-advance-on-projects-1st-phase/) will rise on a parking lot between 63rd and 64th streets along Dorchester Avenue, next to the Metra Electric tracks:

- **Two 14-story towers** (160 feet tall) connected by a three-story podium
- **231 residential units** plus a hotel
- **26,000 square feet of retail** at street level
- **300 parking spaces**

The full buildout envisions roughly 870 housing units across multiple phases, including workforce, market-rate, luxury, and senior housing, plus 215,000 square feet of office and retail. Future phases would add a performance venue, vertical greenhouse, and energy facility.

Brazier is threading the needle between celebrating Black culture and coexisting with the Obama Presidential Center, set to open in June. "With the Obama center coming up, we know that there's going to be need for lodging; there's going to be need for other cultural aspects," he told the Sun-Times. "We're looking at trying to have some semblance of connectivity, but letting the Obama center and its opening breathe."

# Bike Infrastructure

## Federal Order Halts Future Bike Lane Funding

U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has [ordered a stop to all grants](https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/possible-federal-bike-lane-expansion-chicago/) for new bike lanes and green infrastructure—a move that could significantly impact Chicago's expansion plans. Projects already under construction retain their allocated funding, but future federal dollars are now frozen.

The timing is particularly unfortunate. Chicago just celebrated a [record 12.9 million shared bike and scooter trips](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2026/january/micromobility-record-year.html) in 2025, and CDOT added 140 new Divvy stations with over 2,000 docks last year. Demand has never been higher.

Meanwhile, local budget pressures add to the challenge. The 2025–2029 Capital Improvement Program already proposed [cutting Complete Streets and Vision Zero funding](https://chi.streetsblog.org/2025/12/10/documents-show-the-main-funding-source-for-crash-prevention-dropping-from-791m-to-212m-to-help-cover-firefighter-back-pay-and-police-misconduct-settlements) from $791 million to $212 million—a 70% reduction. Under current projections, only 23 miles of bikeways are planned for 2026, down from over 50 miles in each of the prior two years.

Construction on the Near West Side around Harrison Street continues for now, using previously allocated funds. But the federal freeze casts a long shadow over what comes next.

# The Deep Freeze

## Extreme Cold Cancels Schools, Events

In case you missed it while huddled under blankets: an [Extreme Cold Warning](https://www.wbez.org/in-the-loop-with-sasha-ann-simons/2026/01/23/wbezs-weekly-news-recap-jan-23-2026-dangerous-cold-cardinal-criticizes-trump-and-more) gripped Chicago yesterday, with wind chills plunging to minus 36 degrees at O'Hare. [CPS canceled classes](https://www.cps.edu/media/community-updates/2026/january/classes-canceled-january-23/) Friday as the city opened 284 warming centers. The Chicago Polar Plunge was also canceled—perhaps the only time "it's too cold for the Polar Plunge" has been literally true.

Conditions are moderating today, though still frigid. If you're heading to [Polar Adventure Day at Northerly Island](https://abc7chicago.com/eyewitness-news-at-11am---january-23-2026/18456050/) this afternoon for free fishing lessons and nature play, bundle up.
