# Lead Poisoning Prevention

## Small and Diverse Firms Land First Lead Pipe Contracts

Mayor Brandon Johnson announced that three minority- and women-owned construction companies have been awarded the city's first Lead Service Line Replacement Small Business Initiative contracts, [totaling over $1.67 million](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2026/january/lead-service-replacement-contracts.html).

The program reflects adjustments made after feedback from contractors: bonding requirements were reduced from 100% to 33-1/3% of bid amounts, insurance requirements were modified, and project scopes were divided to create more accessible opportunities. Additional solicitations are expected in Q1 2026.

"Small and diverse businesses are the heartbeat of our local economy," Mayor Johnson said. "Ensuring their success creates generational impact in our communities."

The initiative arrives as federal support remains uncertain. [Congress may cut $125 million](https://chicago.suntimes.com/environment/2026/01/13/states-say-they-need-more-help-replacing-lead-pipes-congress-may-cut-funding-instead) from lead pipe replacement funding this year, and Senator Duckworth has [called for restoration](https://news.wttw.com/2026/01/15/sen-duckworth-calls-restoration-125m-cut-lead-service-line-replacement-budget-slashing) of those cuts by redirecting ICE funding. Chicago faces the nation's largest lead pipe challenge—over 400,000 service lines, with less than 4% replaced so far.

# Bike Infrastructure

## Divvy and Lime Set Ridership Record

Chicagoans took [12.9 million trips on shared bikes and scooters](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2026/january/micromobility-record-year.html) in 2025—the highest annual total on record and nearly 2 million more than 2024. Divvy logged 6.8 million rides (its best year ever), while Lime contributed 6.1 million.

The city invested over $3 million in Divvy last year, adding 140 new stations with over 2,000 docks. More than 1,000 new bike racks and dozens of bike corrals were installed citywide. All shared scooters now include sidewalk riding detection technology.

Affordability remains a focus: the Divvy for Everyone program offers $5 annual memberships for eligible residents, while Lime provides automatic 50% discounts for trips starting in South and West Side neighborhoods.

Meanwhile, the [South Loop bike lane project remains paused](https://blockclubchicago.org/2026/01/09/south-loop-bike-lane-project-paused-some-lanes-removed-as-officials-reassess/). Construction of protected lanes at 18th and Wabash was halted at Ald. Pat Dowell's request last fall, with some previously installed lanes removed pending reassessment.

# Vegan Chicago

## Bloom Plant Based Kitchen to Close February 21

[Bloom Plant Based Kitchen](https://vegconomist.com/gastronomy-food-service/food-service/chicago-vegan-restaurant-bloom-close-earning-spot-among-citys-best/), the Wicker Park vegan and gluten-free restaurant recently named one of Chicago's best by TimeOut, will close permanently after Valentine's Day service.

Chef and founder Rodolfo Cuadros said the closure wasn't an easy decision but hinted at evolution: "The goal is to create something new that carries Bloom's spirit forward."

Bloom joins a [wave of Chicago vegan closures](https://www.chicagotribune.com/2026/01/05/chicago-vegan-restaurant-closures/): Chicago Diner shuttered its Logan Square location, Chicago Raw closed, and Kitchen 17—known for its housemade vegan deep-dish—is gone. The Lakeview Chicago Diner remains open.

Nemanja Golubovic of Kale My Name pointed to rising costs for ingredients, rent, labor, and utilities colliding with tighter consumer spending. Chicago's long winters and seasonal foot traffic compound the challenge. "The landscape is evolving rather than disappearing," he said. "Veganism itself is not going anywhere."

# Immigration

## Federal Agents to Begin Leaving Minneapolis

In a [significant development](https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/live-updates/reported-shooting-south-minneapolis-federal-agents-protesters/), some federal immigration agents will begin leaving Minneapolis tomorrow following a phone call between President Trump and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey.

"The president agreed that the present situation cannot continue," Frey said. Border czar Tom Homan will meet with Frey on Tuesday. CBP commander-at-large Greg Bovino is [returning to California](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/minute-minute-timeline-fatal-shooting-alex-pretti-federal/story?id=129547199) to resume his duties.

A [growing number of Republicans](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alex-pretti-shooting-minneapolis-growing-number-of-republicans-criticize-trump-admin-response/)—including Senator Lisa Murkowski and House Homeland Security Chairman Andrew Garbarino—are calling for deeper investigation into the shooting of Alex Pretti, the ICU nurse killed by Border Patrol agents Friday. Video evidence reviewed by multiple outlets [appears to contradict](https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/25/us/alex-pretti-shooting-minneapolis-videos-witnesses-invs) DHS's initial account. U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez has ordered the administration to respond to Minnesota's argument that Operation Metro Surge was created to "punish" the state.

## Committee Meeting Today: Welcoming City Ordinance

The [Joint Committee on Immigrant & Refugee Rights and Police & Fire](https://40thward.org/city-council/committee-immigrant-refugee-rights/) meets today at 1:00 PM to discuss gaps in Chicago's Welcoming City Ordinance—timing that could hardly be more pointed. The first 30 minutes is dedicated to public comment, both in-person and virtual. Meetings are livestreamed at [chicityclerk.com](https://www.chicityclerk.com/).

*The Committee on Housing and Real Estate also meets today. With Chicago's citywide ADU ordinance set to take effect April 1, housing policy continues to move—even if progress on lead pipes remains measured in thousands against hundreds of thousands.*
