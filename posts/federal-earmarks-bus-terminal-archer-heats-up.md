## $46.2 Million in Federal Earmarks

Mayor Brandon Johnson [announced this week](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2026/february/federal-appropriations-fy26.html) that Illinois' Congressional delegation secured $46.2 million in federal funds for 40 projects across Chicago—a 70.7% increase from FY2024.

Of particular interest to readers of this newsletter: **$2 million** goes to the Department of Water Management for lead service line replacements across multiple wards.

Other highlights:

- **$7.35 million** for affordable housing projects including Encounter Square Phase II ($3.15M), Belray Apartments ($850K), and Joyce Chapman Apartments ($250K)
- **$6.33 million** for CTA projects including track reconstruction design and station improvements
- **$4.85 million** for homeless shelter infrastructure
- **$2 million** for the new Bronzeville Senior Center

"These projects will allow us to replace lead pipes and support our seniors while making critical investments in public safety infrastructure, equipment, and facilities," the Mayor said.

The lead funding is a drop in the bucket for a city with an estimated 400,000 lead service lines—the most of any U.S. city—but every pipe replaced is one fewer household at risk. Illinois law gives Chicago until 2077 to replace them all.

## Archer Avenue: A Political Flashpoint

The Archer Avenue bike lane project in Brighton Park has become more than a street redesign—it's now a [proxy battle for local political power](https://southsideweekly.com/archer-ave-bike-lanes-tension-fuels-political-ambitions/).

The project, part of the city's Complete Streets Program, includes protected bike lanes, pedestrian refuge islands, and traffic-calming measures. Construction began in late 2025 and is expected to wrap up in early 2026.

The opposition is organized. Urban Center, a pro-charter-school advocacy group led by former UNO CEO Juan Rangel, has coordinated rallies through mass texts explicitly naming Ald. Julia Ramirez (12th) and Mayor Johnson. Eva Villalobos, a former school board candidate, has emerged as a visible organizer, describing the group as "a response to decisions being 'forced' onto the community."

Claudia Zuno, a Brighton Park organizer working with Urban Center, has hinted at "stepping forward" if Ramirez doesn't change course—raising questions about whether bike lanes are the real issue or just the wedge.

Meanwhile, the safety data speaks for itself: Brighton Park sees **90% more traffic crashes** than Chicago's average, with over 6,000 crashes, 1,500 injuries, and 13 fatalities on record. Supporters like Alfredo Valladares Jr. of Gage Park Cyclists argue that protected infrastructure is precisely what the corridor needs.

## A Modest Proposal for the Bus Terminal

The Chaddick Institute at DePaul has released [design renderings](https://chi.streetsblog.org/2026/02/05/extreme-makeover-bus-station-edition-as-the-city-greases-the-wheels-for-buying-the-terminal-chaddick-institute-proposes-an-affordable-facelift) for a budget-friendly renovation of the Greyhound bus station at 630 W. Harrison St.—the same terminal that nearly faced eviction in September 2024.

The City plans to purchase and upgrade the facility using approximately $50 million in TIF funds ($35M for acquisition, $15M for renovations). The Department of Planning and Development held a public hearing last week to expand the Canal/Congress TIF district to include the station.

The Chaddick proposal includes:
- A new glass entrance at street level, replacing the current "dark, sunken entry"
- Chicago flag colors and "CHI" signage visible from I-90
- A "Welcome to Chicago" mural

"This is not a billion-dollar wish list," said Chaddick Institute director Joe Schwieterman. "This is just a super-modest change" focused on user experience.

**Timeline**: The Community Development Commission will consider the proposal in April, with a City Council vote possible on May 20.

## Ukrainian Village: 40 Units Get Green Light

A [four-story, 40-unit apartment building](https://blockclubchicago.org/2026/02/02/proposed-40-unit-building-on-humboldt-park-ukrainian-village-border-wins-aldermans-support/) proposed for 2652 W. Chicago Ave. has won support from Ald. Gilbert Villegas (36th).

Developer Barrett Homes scaled back from an original 57-unit, five-story proposal. The current plan includes 23 parking spaces, ground-floor retail, and six affordable units.

"Developments like 2652 W. Chicago Avenue, which increase density and generate more tax revenue, are key to neighborhoods being walkable, transit-oriented," Villegas said.

Some neighbors worry about parking—the site lacks a nearby "L" station—but supporters argue that more housing supply is the best path to affordability citywide.

## ADU Countdown: 54 Days

April 1 approaches. The [citywide ADU ordinance](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/doh/provdrs/homeowners/svcs/adu-ordinance.html) takes effect, expanding eligibility to all multifamily zoning districts. Applications open April 1.
