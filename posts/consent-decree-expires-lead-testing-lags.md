## Consent Decree Expires Today

The [Castañon Nava consent decree](https://immigrantjustice.org/press-release/federal-judge-extends-consent-decree-prohibiting-ice-from-arresting-people-without-warrants-or-probable-cause/)—a federal agreement prohibiting ICE from arresting people without warrants or probable cause—expired yesterday, February 2. The decree had applied to ICE operations in Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, Kentucky, and Wisconsin.

In October 2025, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Cummings found that ICE agents had violated the decree during the early weeks of the second Trump administration, and extended it through yesterday. With the decree now expired, immigrant advocates are watching closely for what comes next. Mayor Johnson's [Executive Order 2026-01](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2026/january/ice-on-notice.html), signed Friday, represents the city's attempt to establish alternative accountability mechanisms.

## COPA Amendment Headed for Full Council Vote

The City Council [will vote February 18](https://news.wttw.com/2026/02/02/alderpeople-say-copa-should-investigate-chicago-police-conduct-during-immigration-raids) on a proposal granting the Civilian Office of Police Accountability authority to investigate whether CPD officers violated the Welcoming City Ordinance by assisting federal immigration agents.

COPA's new chief administrator, LaKenya White, told a joint committee session that her office is prepared to investigate 40 complaints filed against CPD over its interactions with federal agents since June. Advocates have documented officers blocking streets, protecting ICE vehicles, and "escorting" agents to their destinations—activities they say violate the city's sanctuary policy.

The amendment, introduced by Alds. Jessie Fuentes (26th) and Andre Vasquez (40th), would clarify that COPA—rather than the inspector general or Bureau of Internal Affairs—is the proper body to investigate such complaints.

## Chicago Tests Just 0.01% of Homes for Lead in Water

A sobering [Axios report](https://www.axios.com/local/chicago/2026/01/30/chicago-lead-testing-elgin) published January 30 reveals that Chicago has tested only 0.01% of its homes for lead in water—a stark contrast to its nearly 400,000 lead service lines, the most of any U.S. city.

The Department of Water Management is sending about 3,000 notification letters per week, with a 10–12% response rate. Officials acknowledge they can't send all 900,000 required notifications at once: "There are not enough physical lead-sampling bottles in the country to be able to fulfill those requests."

The timing is notable as Chicago's neighbor to the northwest makes headlines for the opposite reason. Elgin, with the state's second-largest number of lead lines, recently found [dangerously elevated lead levels](https://www.chicagotribune.com/2026/01/16/elgin-lead-water-tests-lines-replacement/)—56.7 parts per billion—in 70 of 101 homes tested, nearly four times the EPA's action threshold of 15 ppb.

Chicago has drawn only $70–90 million of a $325 million federal loan that expires next year, though officials say they expect to spend "much more quickly" in 2026. The city doesn't anticipate replacing all its lead pipes until 2076—some 30 years after the federal deadline.

## ADU Countdown: 57 Days to April 1

Chicago's citywide ADU ordinance takes effect April 1, 2026, ending the pilot program that had been limited to five areas since May 2021. The [September 2025 ordinance](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/doh/provdrs/homeowners/svcs/adu-ordinance.html) passed unanimously, 46-0.

The new rules allow coach houses (detached backyard units) on any property with 1–4 units, and conversion units in buildings at least 20 years old. Properties with five or more units can add up to 33% more units through conversions, with every other unit required to be affordable at 60% AMI for 30 years.

Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi has confirmed that building an ADU will not raise neighbors' assessments, and homeowners may qualify for a Home Improvement Exemption to offset tax increases for up to four years.

Applications can be submitted starting April 1.

# Bikes

## Federal Funding Freeze Casts Shadow Over Expansion

U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has signaled readiness to [halt future federal funding](https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/possible-federal-bike-lane-expansion-chicago/) for bike lane expansion—a potential blow to Chicago's infrastructure plans even as the city saw record Divvy ridership in 2025 (6.8 million trips).

Currently funded projects remain on track, including the contentious second phase of the [Grand Avenue project](https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/08/18/second-phase-of-grand-avenue-bike-lane-street-upgrades-now-expected-in-2026/), set to extend protected lanes from Damen to Ogden this year. But a coalition of business owners continues pushing for the city to replace protected bike lanes with shared bus-bike lanes instead.

Meanwhile, construction on the [Archer Avenue redesign](https://southsideweekly.com/archer-ave-bike-lanes-tension-fuels-political-ambitions/) in Brighton Park, which began in late 2025, is expected to wrap up in early 2026. CDOT data shows the corridor accounts for a disproportionate share of the neighborhood's traffic injuries and fatalities.
