## Council Committee Backs Rat Birth Control Pilot

The Committee on Environmental Protection and Energy [met Tuesday](https://www.axios.com/local/chicago/2026/02/05/chicago-rat-control-birth-control-pilot-city-council-lincoln-park) and advanced a resolution formally recognizing Lincoln Park's rat contraceptive pilot—a humane alternative to the rodenticides that have killed raptors and owls across the North Side.

"It's rat birth control," Ald. Timmy Knudsen (43rd) told colleagues. "I could eat it, it wouldn't harm me." The pellets contain a plant extract that interrupts sperm production and egg release; rats must consume them every 30–60 days to remain sterile.

Knudsen testified that he hopes the city will eventually move toward "abatement done with more innovative, humane and sustainable materials." Early indicators are promising: "You start to see the impact, the rat population start to go down around months six through eight... and then they go down drastically after that."

The pilot, led by the [Chicago Bird Alliance](https://chicagobirdalliance.org/blog/2025/7/20/a-trial-of-rat-contraceptive) and Lincoln Park Zoo, was launched in response to the [deaths of three beloved Great Horned Owls](https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/08/27/chicago-rat-contraceptives-lincoln-park-owls/) near North Pond last spring—all traced to rodenticide exposure. Despite a $14.6 million rat control budget, Chicago was named the "rattiest city" in the U.S. for the tenth consecutive year in 2024, and research suggests rats are developing tolerance to the poison.

The pilot runs through this summer; expansion could follow.

## Committee Also Eyes Waterway Cleanup

The same committee meeting considered a resolution supporting a long-term reclamation study for the [Chicago Area Waterway System](https://mwrd.org/what-we-do/reducing-flooding/chicago-area-waterway-system-caws) (CAWS)—the 76 miles of canals and engineered river segments that wind through the city.

Sponsored by Alderpersons Brian Hopkins, Samantha Nugent, and Matthew Martin, the measure frames the study as a step toward remediation and habitat restoration. Advocates point to chronic contamination problems affecting everything from kayaking to public health along the waterways.

## Chicago Sets New Micromobility Record

The city [announced](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2026/january/micromobility-record-year.html) that shared bikes and scooters logged nearly 13 million trips in 2025—a new record. Divvy alone accounted for 6.8 million rides, with e-bike and scooter trips each growing by over 20%.

CDOT added 140 new Divvy stations with more than 2,000 docks last year. The [Divvy for Everyone](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdot/provdrs/bike/svcs/divvy_for_everyone.html) program, which offers $5 annual memberships for income-eligible residents, continued to support ridership growth.

Evanston is joining the expansion: city council [voted to grow the system](https://dailynorthwestern.com/2026/02/02/data-visualization/by-the-numbers-bikesharing-data-suggests-northwestern-community-driving-divvy-in-evanston/) from 14 to up to 31 stations, with site selection underway. Data suggest Northwestern students drive much of the demand—34.5% of Evanston's Divvy trips began or ended on campus.
