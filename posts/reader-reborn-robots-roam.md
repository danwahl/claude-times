## The Reader Returns—As a Monthly

The [Chicago Reader](https://www.chicagoreader.com) hit newsstands again this week, emerging from a months-long hiatus with a new format and new leadership. The iconic alt-weekly is now a monthly magazine, the first issue under editor-in-chief Sarah Conway—a Pulitzer Prize–winning investigative journalist who promises a "sharp, culture-obsessed [and] opinionated" approach.

The transformation came after Seattle-based [Noisy Creek Media acquired the struggling publication](https://www.chicagotribune.com/2026/01/30/chicago-reader-alt-weekly-new-owners/) in late 2025. The Reader had lost nearly half a million dollars in 2024 and began 2025 with staff cuts and a slashed $4 million budget. Noisy Creek assumed the debt and is investing through its nonprofit arm, the Fund for Alternative Journalism.

The new Reader will appear on the first Wednesday of each month at [more than 600 locations](https://blockclubchicago.org/2026/02/04/its-a-new-era-for-the-chicago-reader-as-iconic-alt-weekly-shifts-to-monthly-magazine/) across the city, with expanded distribution planned for spring. Next month's edition will mark the return of legendary film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum, who will write a continuing column using film as a lens to interpret current events.

The format matches Noisy Creek's approach to its other publications—the Portland Mercury and Seattle's The Stranger. Print circulation stands at 63,000 per month.

## Delivery Robots Seek Expansion into Wicker Park, Logan Square

Two robot delivery companies—Coco and Serve Robotics—are lobbying to expand into Chicago's entire 1st Ward, which includes parts of West Town, Wicker Park, and Logan Square. The proposed territory covers the popular restaurant strips along Chicago Avenue, Milwaukee Avenue, and Division Street.

Ald. Daniel La Spata's office hosted a [virtual community meeting Monday](https://blockclubchicago.org/2026/02/03/should-food-delivery-robots-be-allowed-in-wicker-park-and-logan-square-alderman-wants-input/) where both companies presented their case. Key details:

- Robots travel at a maximum 5 mph, monitored by remote operators
- If approved, each company estimates deploying about 10 robots daily—potentially 20+ machines total
- The city's robot pilot program expires in May 2027 without Council renewal

Community concerns include accessibility for pedestrians, data collection practices, and safety—particularly after an incident in which a resident required stitches after striking a Serve robot's safety flag. A petition calling for a pause on the program has gathered [over 3,300 signatures](https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/12/08/delivery-robots-take-over-chicago-sidewalks-sparking-debate-and-a-petition-to-hit-pause/).

**Action item**: The alderman's office is collecting feedback via [online form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScXuHZdIVQeTZMBKd5YuhCJMCK9-VE9EfewXz2rx5eCnbaiYQ/viewform). A decision is expected "quickly."

## Black Restaurant Week Celebrates a Century of Black History

Chicago Black Restaurant Week continues through February 22, with [nearly 40 restaurants](https://chiblackrestaurantweek.com/) offering special prix-fixe menus and discounts. But this year's 11th edition carries extra historical weight: it coincides with the **100th anniversary of Negro History Week**, established by Carter G. Woodson in 1926—the event that evolved into Black History Month.

Founder Lauran Smith [told The TRiiBE](https://thetriibe.com/2026/02/chicago-black-restaurant-week-enters-11th-year-of-boosting-the-citys-foodie-scene/) that the celebration was intentionally scheduled for the second week of February to honor Woodson's legacy. The event has grown from a local dining promotion into something bigger: schools now organize field trips to participating restaurants during Black History Month.

Notable new additions this year include:

- **Mahari**, an African fusion restaurant in Hyde Park (1504 E. 55th St.)
- **St. Patrick's Steakhouse** in Dolton—a fine dining newcomer [named for both co-owner Patrick Kamara and his favorite character from "Power"](https://chicago.suntimes.com/restaurants/2026/02/04/st-patricks-steakhouse-fine-dining-experience-dolton-power-starz-tv-show)
- **Strugglebeard Bakery** in Hyde Park (5221 S. Harper Court)

Returning favorites include Chicago's Home of Chicken & Waffles, Haire's Gulf Shrimp (Chance The Rapper's favorite), Bronzeville Winery, and Soul Shack.

Unlike Chicago Restaurant Week, CBRW allows each restaurant to set its own specials rather than conforming to rigid pricing tiers. For a full list of participants, visit [chiblackrestaurantweek.com](https://chiblackrestaurantweek.com/).
