## Committee Greenlights COPA Enforcement Amendment

The joint Committee on Immigrant & Refugee Rights and Police & Fire [advanced an amendment](https://www.fox32chicago.com/news/chicago-leaders-move-to-tighten-enforcement-of-welcoming-city-ordinance-after-minneapolis-killing) yesterday that would grant the Civilian Office of Police Accountability investigative authority over violations of the Welcoming City Ordinance.

Under the proposal, COPA could investigate cases where Chicago police officers or other city officials cooperate with federal immigration enforcement in ways that violate the city's sanctuary policy. The amendment now heads to the full City Council.

"We're making sure that we have the infrastructure and the systems to hold people accountable," one alder told reporters. Another expressed urgency: "If we don't make these changes now, I fear for what it will look like between now and March, when ICE does come back."

Mayor Brandon Johnson said additional steps, including possible executive orders, are under review.

## Mayor Marches with "Abolish ICE" Protesters

In a striking display of the city's posture toward federal enforcement, Mayor Johnson [joined demonstrators](https://wabcradio.com/2026/01/26/chicago-mayor-joins-anti-ice-protest/) carrying "Abolish ICE" signs during a Monday march. The move aligns him publicly with activists who oppose federal immigration enforcement—a notable position for a sitting mayor amid ongoing federal operations.

## Minneapolis: Two Agents Fired Weapons; Commander Leaving

Developments in Minneapolis continue to reverberate. A [preliminary CBP report to Congress](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/two-federal-agents-fired-their-weapons-during-alex-pretti-shooting-report-congress-says/) confirms that two Border Patrol agents fired their weapons during the January 24 shooting that killed Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old VA nurse with a valid carry permit and no criminal record.

The New York Times reported approximately ten shots were fired over five seconds. [Video evidence reviewed by multiple outlets](https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/25/us/alex-pretti-shooting-minneapolis-videos-witnesses-invs) continues to contradict the Department of Homeland Security's initial account of events.

CBP commander Gregory Bovino and some Border Patrol agents are [expected to leave Minneapolis](https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/live-updates/reported-shooting-south-minneapolis-federal-agents-protesters/) following a call between President Trump and Mayor Jacob Frey. The president [confirmed his administration is "reviewing everything"](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-confirms-federal-review-minneapolis-shooting-killed-nurse-reviewing-everything) about the incident.

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara noted Pretti's death "is the third shooting now in less than three weeks" by federal agents. Of Minneapolis's three homicides in 2026, two have been committed by federal immigration enforcement officers.

*The Welcoming City Ordinance dates to 2012, with additional protections added in 2021. COPA, created in 2016, investigates allegations of police misconduct—but until now has lacked explicit authority over sanctuary policy violations. The proposed amendment would close that gap.*
