## Congress Cuts Lead Pipe Funding by $125 Million

The House [voted 217-214 on Tuesday](https://www.circleofblue.org/newsletter/fresh-february-11-2026-house-vote-slashes-lead-pipe-funding-as-great-lakes-cities-face-decades-long-replacement-backlog/) to approve an appropriations bill that slashes $125 million from federal lead service line replacement funding—a blow to Great Lakes cities already decades behind on removing toxic pipes.

The cut targets money from the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which set aside $15 billion over five years for states to replace lead pipes. An [earlier House draft](https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/2026/01/08/federal-spending-package-would-cut-lead-pipe-replacement-funding/) proposed cutting $250 million; 45 House Democrats signed a letter urging leaders to restore full funding, and salvaged half.

Chicago has more lead service lines than any city in the country: [412,000](https://chicago.suntimes.com/environment/2025/09/22/lead-pipes-chicago-city-council-notification-federal-loans-unspent). Despite an EPA mandate to replace them all by 2047, city officials don't expect to finish until 2076. Water department officials [say they can't afford](https://chicago.suntimes.com/environment/2026/01/13/states-say-they-need-more-help-replacing-lead-pipes-congress-may-cut-funding-instead) to move faster without more federal support.

The math is grim. Since 2023, Chicago has drawn $70-90 million of a $325 million federal loan that expires next year. The total estimated cost to replace all lines: [$12 billion](https://ilenviro.org/lead-service-line-replacement-in-chicago/).

NRDC senior strategic director Erik Olson [called the cuts](https://www.envirolink.org/2026/02/08/congressional-budget-cuts-eliminate-125-million-for-removing-dangerous-lead-pipes-from-drinking-water-systems/) "penny-wise and pound-foolish, since the health and economic benefits of removing these lead pipes are more than 14 times the costs."

## Missing Middle Expands to Garfield Park, McKinley Park

The city [announced February 5](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/dcd/provdrs/ec_dev/news/2026/february/new-missing-middle-residential-projects-selected-garfield-park-mckinley-park.html) that five minority-led development teams have been selected to build 35 multi-unit buildings—99 homes total—in East and West Garfield Park and McKinley Park. The projects, valued at $35.5 million, will replace vacant city lots with two-, three-, and four-flats sold to owner-occupants earning up to 140% of area median income.

Combined with last week's South Side approvals, the Missing Middle initiative now has more than 200 units advancing across Chicago's South and West Sides.

## Parking Enforcement Heads to Full Council

The citizen parking enforcement ordinance [cleared committee Monday](https://www.wbez.org/transportation/2026/02/10/parking-scofflaws-ordinance-daniel-laspata-council-traffic-safety-committee-approval) and will come before City Council on February 18.

The measure creates a Street Operations Task Force targeting bus lane, bike lane, and crosswalk violations outside the existing Smart Streets camera zone. By year's end, 311 complaints would be routed to nearby parking enforcement aides for real-time response. Phase one [applies only to commercial vehicles](https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2026/02/09/parking-scofflaws-ordinance-daniel-laspata-council-traffic-safety-committee-approval); retailers and restaurants [pushed for exceptions](https://www.thedailyline.com/chicago-city-council-pedestrian-traffic-safety-committee-february-2026-recap-revised-parking-violation-resident-reporting-pilot-approved-measure-public-hearings-cdot-bridge-closures) when trucks are actively loading.

## Environment Committee Backs Rat Contraceptive Pilot

The Committee on Environmental Protection and Energy [approved a resolution](https://hoodline.com/2026/02/rats-on-the-pill-as-city-hall-panel-pushes-north-side-pilot-and-river-rescue-study/) supporting the Lincoln Park rat contraceptive pilot this week. Ald. Timmy Knudsen (43rd) [told colleagues](https://www.axios.com/local/chicago/2026/02/05/chicago-rat-control-birth-control-pilot-city-council-lincoln-park) he hopes to "work towards a day where abatement is done with more innovative, humane and sustainable materials."

The $40,000 privately funded study—a partnership between Knudsen's office, Lincoln Park Zoo, Chicago Bird Alliance, and Streets & Sanitation—uses [WISDOM GoodBites pellets](https://chicagobirdalliance.org/rat-contraceptive-pilot-program) containing a plant extract that interrupts reproduction without hormones. Rats must consume it every 30-60 days to remain infertile.

The real test comes this spring when rats emerge in warmer weather. Researchers will compare populations on treated blocks versus control blocks.
