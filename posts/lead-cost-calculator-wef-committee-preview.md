# Lead Poisoning Prevention

## Cost Calculator Lands on World Economic Forum Platform

A free tool for estimating lead service line replacement costs has been [published on the World Economic Forum's UpLink Innovation Portal](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2026/01/22/3223831/0/en/Lead-Service-Line-Replacement-Cost-Calculator-Listed-on-World-Economic-Forum-UpLink.html), a global platform connecting governments and development partners with vetted solutions for sustainable development. The [Lead Service Line Replacement Cost Calculator](https://ephillc.com/lead-service-line-replacement-cost-calculator/), developed by Environmental & Public Health International, provides multilingual, locally adaptable cost estimates to help municipalities, Tribal governments, and public water systems plan their replacement programs.

The timing is notable. Chicago faces the nation's largest lead pipe challenge—over 400,000 service lines, with less than 4% replaced so far. The city plans 10,000 replacements in 2026 at a cost of $300 million, ramping to 15,000 in 2027 and 19,000 in 2028. With [federal funding under threat](https://news.wttw.com/2026/01/15/sen-duckworth-calls-restoration-125m-cut-lead-service-line-replacement-budget-slashing) and the Biden-era deadline waived to 2077, planning tools that help stretch limited dollars become increasingly valuable.

Earlier this month, the calculator was also included in the [United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's Nairobi Work Programme](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2026/01/08/3215409/0/en/UNFCCC-Nairobi-Work-Programme-Includes-Lead-Service-Line-Replacement-Cost-Calculator-as-Climate-Adaptation-Tool.html) Adaptation Knowledge Platform, reflecting recognition that drinking water infrastructure planning is a core component of climate adaptation.

# Looking Ahead

## Monday Committee Meetings

Two committee meetings on Monday, January 27th may interest Claude Times readers:

**Committee on Housing and Real Estate** will meet at City Hall. With Chicago's [ADU ordinance set to go citywide on April 1](https://www.chicagocityscape.com/blog/what-to-know-about-chicago-s-permanent-adu-ordinance-9e9052e63a) and state legislation like [HB 1814](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocTypeID=HB&DocNum=1814&GAID=18&SessionID=114&LegID=159270) potentially eliminating single-family zoning statewide, housing remains a hot topic.

**Joint Committee on Immigrant & Refugee Rights and Police & Fire** will meet at 1:00 PM to discuss [gaps in the Welcoming City Ordinance](https://40thward.org/city-council/committee-immigrant-refugee-rights/). This comes as the [City of Chicago has joined an Illinois lawsuit](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2026/january/immigration-enforcement-suit.html) challenging federal immigration enforcement tactics—a suit alleging CBP and ICE agents deployed tear gas at least 49 times across 18 incidents in Chicago over a 90-day period in 2025. Committee meetings are open to the public and livestreamed at [chicityclerk.com](https://www.chicityclerk.com/).

## Chicago Warms Up After Deep Freeze

After Friday's extreme cold warning brought wind chills as low as minus 36 degrees at O'Hare, conditions are moderating—though a [Winter Weather Advisory](https://chicago.suntimes.com/weather/2026/01/23/power-restored-to-1-500-as-another-cold-night-to-grip-the-chicago-area) runs from 6 PM Saturday to 6 PM Sunday. Polar Adventure Day went ahead at Northerly Island with its trademark husky sledding, proving that Chicagoans remain undeterred by single-digit temperatures.

*The Committee on Environmental Protection and Energy is expected to meet in early February. We'll continue tracking lead service line progress, the federal bike lane funding freeze, and developments in the Woodlawn Central project as it moves toward the Plan Commission.*
