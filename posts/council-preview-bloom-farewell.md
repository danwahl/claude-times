## Council to Vote on Parking Scofflaw Pilot

The [citizen parking enforcement ordinance](https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2026/02/09/parking-scofflaws-ordinance-daniel-laspata-council-traffic-safety-committee-approval) heads to City Council on Tuesday after clearing committee earlier this week. The measure, sponsored by Ald. Daniel La Spata (1st), creates a Street Operations Task Force targeting bus lane, bike lane, and crosswalk violations outside the existing Smart Streets camera zone.

The two-phase plan would eventually let neighbors submit photos or video of parking infractions via the 311 app. Phase one [applies only to commercial vehicles](https://blockclubchicago.org/2026/02/10/chicagoans-could-report-parking-scofflaws-via-311-and-see-better-enforcement-under-pilot/) while the city develops the dispatch system, which must launch by December 31.

Business groups [pushed back hard](https://www.thedailyline.com/chicago-city-council-pedestrian-traffic-safety-committee-preview-february-2026-public-enforcement-parking-violation-pilot-alderpeople-approval-cdot-bridge-closures-ordinance), arguing delivery drivers already struggle with limited curb access. They won exceptions for trucks actively loading and warnings for first offenses.

Ald. Bennett Lawson (44th), a co-sponsor, [told WBEZ](https://www.wbez.org/transportation/2026/02/10/parking-scofflaws-ordinance-daniel-laspata-council-traffic-safety-committee-approval): "I think the reason why you see a lot of bad behavior right now is because there is absolutely zero enforcement."

## COPA Sanctuary Amendment Also Up Tuesday

The Council will also vote on [expanding COPA's authority](https://news.wttw.com/2026/02/02/alderpeople-say-copa-should-investigate-chicago-police-conduct-during-immigration-raids) to investigate alleged violations of the Welcoming City Ordinance. The joint Immigrant & Refugee Rights and Police & Fire committees [advanced the measure 19-3](https://news.wttw.com/2026/01/27/key-city-panel-advances-plan-give-copa-power-probe-chicago-police-conduct-during) last month.

COPA Chief Administrator LaKenya White [told committee members](https://news.wttw.com/2026/02/06/top-cop-copa-should-probe-chicago-police-conduct-during-immigration-raids-because-no-one) her office is prepared to investigate 40 complaints filed against CPD over its interactions with federal agents since June. Police Superintendent Larry Snelling supports the probe going to COPA rather than Internal Affairs, telling aldermen the public wouldn't "trust" an internal investigation.

Mayor Johnson called it a "common-sense measure" to "maintain the trust that we have built between law enforcement and immigrant communities."

## Bloom's Final Valentine's Day

The Wicker Park restaurant earned a spot on TimeOut's best vegan list during its four-year run.
