## Committee Greenlights Citizen Parking Enforcement

The Committee on Pedestrian and Traffic Safety [voted Monday](https://www.wbez.org/transportation/2026/02/10/parking-scofflaws-ordinance-daniel-laspata-council-traffic-safety-committee-approval) to advance an ordinance that would let Chicagoans use cellphones to document vehicles illegally parked in bus lanes, bike lanes, and crosswalks.

The measure, championed by committee chair Ald. Daniel La Spata (1st), rolls out in two phases. First, the Department of Finance will create a "Street Operations Task Force" of parking enforcement aides focused on bus, bike lane, and crosswalk violations outside the existing Smart Streets camera zone. Second—by December 31, 2026—the city will develop a dispatch system allowing 311 complaints to be routed directly to nearby enforcement aides who can respond immediately and issue tickets.

For now, the program applies only to commercial vehicles. Specifics will be refined through department rulemaking.

Business groups [raised concerns](https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2025/12/03/daniel-laspata-parking-violations-citizen-reporting-ordinance-business-community) that drivers sometimes have no legal loading zone and could face a wave of citizen-triggered tickets. La Spata countered that the revised ordinance will "lead to greater safety for all Chicagoans, and in a way that is really responsible and collaborative."

The full Council must still approve the measure. Departments are expected to report on Phase One progress by July.

## Bloom's Last Week

[Bloom Plant Based Kitchen](https://bloompb.com/) in Wicker Park enters its final ten days of service. The restaurant, led by James Beard–nominated chef Rodolfo Cuadros, will close permanently after February 21.

Cuadros told [VegNews](https://vegnews.com/chicago-vegan-restaurants-closing) that the closure is "not an easy decision," but hinted the concept may evolve into something new. Bloom joins a string of Chicago vegan closures—including Kitchen 17, Native Foods, and Chicago Raw—that have shuttered since late 2025. Rising costs, seasonal foot traffic, and shifting consumer habits have all been cited as factors.
