## Homan Takes Charge in Minnesota

Border Czar Tom Homan [arrived in Minnesota](https://www.fox9.com/news/ice-minnesota-latest-jan-28-2026) this week to personally oversee immigration enforcement operations following the deadly shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti. Homan met with Governor Tim Walz, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, and Police Chief Brian O'Hara on Tuesday. He is scheduled to hold a press conference Thursday morning.

The two federal agents who fired at Alex Pretti on January 24 have been [placed on administrative leave](https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/live-updates/dhs-secretary-kristi-noem-under-scrutiny-bovino-exits-minnesota-after-alex-pretti-killing/). Investigators now have body-camera footage from at least four Border Patrol agents present at the scene.

A newly obtained video shows Pretti had a [prior confrontation with federal agents](https://www.fox9.com/news/ice-minnesota-latest-jan-28-2026) eleven days before his death—on January 13, near E. 36th Street and Park Avenue—though that encounter ended without incident.

Governor Walz and President Trump spoke by phone for the first time since Operation Metro Surge began. Walz said Trump committed to "considering his concerns and replacing leadership in Minnesota." Senator Tina Smith has called for ICE agents to leave the state entirely.

## Attorney General on the Ground; Omar Attacked

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced she is "on the ground in Minneapolis" and that 16 people have been arrested for allegedly assaulting federal agents. More arrests are expected.

Separately, Representative Ilhan Omar was [sprayed with an unknown liquid](https://www.fox9.com/news/ice-minnesota-latest-jan-28-2026) at a town hall Tuesday night—hours after President Trump criticized her during remarks in Iowa. The FBI is now leading the investigation.

## Federal Judge Blocks Some Refugee Arrests

A federal judge issued an order temporarily barring the Trump administration from arresting any refugee in Minnesota who lacks a green card but has not been charged with a removable offense. The order also requires the release of refugees fitting that description.

# Bikes

## Divvy Sets New Ridership Record

Chicago residents took [12.9 million shared bike and scooter trips](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2026/january/micromobility-record-year.html) in 2025—nearly 2 million more than the previous year and the highest total on record. Divvy accounted for 6.8 million rides; Lime handled 6.1 million.

CDOT added 140 new Divvy stations with over 2,000 docks, plus more than 1,000 new bike racks and dozens of bike corrals citywide. All shared scooters now feature sidewalk riding detection technology.

On affordability: annual memberships remain frozen at $143 for over 9,200 residents, while 5,500 discounted $99 memberships were added. The Divvy for Everyone program continues offering $5 annual memberships to qualifying low-income residents.

## Bloom Plant Based Kitchen Closing in February

[Bloom Plant Based Kitchen](https://vegconomist.com/gastronomy-food-service/food-service/chicago-vegan-restaurant-bloom-close-earning-spot-among-citys-best/) will permanently close on February 21, the Wicker Park restaurant announced via social media. The James Beard-nominated Chef Rodolfo Cuadros said the closure was "not an easy decision" but hinted the restaurant is "evolving rather than ending."

Bloom becomes the latest in a [wave of Chicago vegan restaurant closures](https://www.chicagotribune.com/2026/01/05/chicago-vegan-restaurant-closures/) that includes Chicago Raw, Kitchen 17, and the Logan Square location of Chicago Diner. Rising costs for ingredients, rent, labor, and insurance—combined with Chicago's long winters and reduced foot traffic—have squeezed operators even as PETA recently named Chicago the "most vegan-friendly city in the country."

The Lakeview Chicago Diner, open since 1983, has said it intends to keep its doors open.

# Lead

## Senate Weighs $125 Million Cut to Lead Pipe Funding

The Senate is considering a House-passed spending package that would [cut $125 million in lead service line replacement funding](https://chicago.suntimes.com/environment/2026/01/13/states-say-they-need-more-help-replacing-lead-pipes-congress-may-cut-funding-instead)—a reduction that would hit Chicago harder than almost any other city.

Senator Tammy Duckworth has proposed [redirecting funds from ICE](https://www.duckworth.senate.gov/news/press-releases/duckworth-pushes-to-slash-ice-funding-and-block-gop-cuts-to-lead-removal-programs) to restore the cuts: "ICE isn't making our communities safer, but protecting our children from lead poisoning actually would."

Chicago has more lead service lines than any American city—over 400,000—and has replaced less than 4% since the effort began five years ago. Plans call for 10,000 replacements this year at a cost of $300 million.

## Small Business Contracts Awarded

In brighter news, the city [awarded four inaugural contracts](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2026/january/lead-service-replacement-contracts.html) totaling $1.67 million to three minority- and women-owned local construction firms through the Lead Service Line Replacement Small Business Initiative. To make participation feasible, the city reduced bonding requirements from 100% to 33⅓% and divided project scopes to create more opportunities.
