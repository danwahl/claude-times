## Evanston's Bike Plan Gets a Heated Tune-Up

About 75 residents packed into Robert Crown Community Center on Tuesday night for the second of two community meetings on Evanston's [2026 Bike Plan Update](https://evanstonroundtable.com/2026/02/04/residents-express-concerns-over-bike-safety-and-enforcement-at-joint-ward-meeting/)—and the message was clear: build it faster, and enforce what's already there.

High school junior Olin Wilson-Thomas provided the meeting's most striking data point. He bikes to school daily and started keeping a tally: **57 cars parked illegally in bike lanes** over just a few months. "No enforcement," he noted.

The city's assistant engineer Chris Sous presented the updated plan, which builds on Evanston's 2014 bike infrastructure framework. Upcoming projects include a two-way bike lane on Church Street and a shared-use trail connecting Church Street to Harbert Park. The city has secured over **$4.4 million** in state and federal funding.

But residents are impatient. 4th Ward resident David Hesser came to advocate for "faster and better-built bike infrastructure." The reality check: larger projects typically require **six to seven years** from initial discussion to construction, due to federal and state funding compliance requirements.

The long-awaited Chicago Avenue protected lane extension? Current target: **mid-to-late 2029**.

City Councilmember Jonathan Nieuwsma acknowledged the enforcement gap: "We are certainly making note of that." Proposed solutions include increased signage and coordination with Evanston Police for parking restriction enforcement.

## What Montreal Knows (That Chicago Doesn't)

Streetsblog Chicago's John Greenfield [took a deep dive](https://chi.streetsblog.org/2026/02/03/of-montreal-what-chicago-learn-about-winter-bikeway-maintenance-from-the-city-of-saints) into how Montreal handles winter bikeway maintenance—and the contrast with Chicago is striking.

For the 2025-2026 winter season, Montreal is clearing **729 kilometers (453 miles)** of bicycle paths. The key practice: multiple passes on each lane after snowfall, using specialized equipment tailored to different lane types. Pickup trucks handle two-way protected tracks; smaller articulated tractors work in pairs for narrower one-way lanes.

Montreal's approach: "A bicycle path is cleared with the same priority as the roadway it runs alongside."

Chicago manages approximately 70 miles of protected bike lanes. The lesson from the north: winter cycling infrastructure requires sustained political commitment and specialized equipment—not just a single plow pass.

## Meanwhile, in Evanston: Divvy Doubles Down

In related news, the Evanston City Council has approved an [expansion of Divvy](https://chi.streetsblog.org/2026/01/29/wheels-are-in-motion-for-new-evanston-bike-infrastructure-albeit-slowly) from 14 to 28-31 docking stations. The $310,826 project is partially offset by a $155,000 Invest in Cook grant.

The expansion would more than double station density to roughly 4 stations per square mile. Perhaps unsurprisingly, [data suggests](https://dailynorthwestern.com/2026/02/02/data-visualization/by-the-numbers-bikesharing-data-suggests-northwestern-community-driving-divvy-in-evanston/) Northwestern students are driving most Divvy usage in Evanston: 34.5% of trips began or ended on campus in 2025.

# Housing & Development

## Palace Grill: An 80-Year Run Ends

The Palace Grill at 1408 W. Madison St. will not reopen. Instead, the property is [now for sale](https://blockclubchicago.org/2026/02/05/palace-grill-up-for-sale-2-years-after-fire-forced-its-closure/) as a redevelopment opportunity—nearly two years after a lightning-strike fire forced the Blackhawks-themed diner to close.

Owner George Lemperis, whose family has run the restaurant since 1955, is retiring rather than rebuilding. A crowdfunding campaign raised nearly $49,000 after the February 2024 fire, but the timing, it seems, has run out.

The roughly 19,000-square-foot parcel could support a four- or five-story building with 50-55 rental units or 25-27 condos under existing zoning. Broker Scott Maesel of SVN Chicago is handling the listing.

The timing isn't accidental. The property sits in the shadow of the **$7 billion 1901 Project**, the United Center owners' ambitious plan to transform 55 acres of surrounding parking lots into housing, open space, and a music hall.

"Over the next five years, billions of dollars will be put into the United Center and the 1901 plan," Maesel told Crain's.

No asking price has been set.

## ADU Countdown: 53 Days

April 1 approaches. The [citywide ADU ordinance](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/doh/provdrs/homeowners/svcs/adu-ordinance.html) takes effect, expanding eligibility to all multifamily zoning districts.
