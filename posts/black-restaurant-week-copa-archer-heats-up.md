## Chicago Black Restaurant Week Kicks Off

[Chicago Black Restaurant Week](https://chiblackrestaurantweek.com/) begins today, running through February 22. Now in its 11th year, the celebration features nearly 40 Black-owned restaurants offering special fixed-price menus—a format that lets each owner set their own "community deal" rather than conforming to rigid pricing tiers.

New additions this year include Sanders BBQ Supply Co. in Beverly and CheSa's Bistro in Avondale. The event has grown from a local dining promotion into something bigger: [schools now organize field trips](https://thetriibe.com/2026/02/chicago-black-restaurant-week-enters-11th-year-of-boosting-the-citys-foodie-scene/) to participating restaurants during Black History Month, and out-of-town visitors increasingly make the trip specifically for CBRW.

For the complete list of participating restaurants, visit [the official website](https://chiblackrestaurantweek.com/) or [the Sun-Times roundup](https://chicago.suntimes.com/restaurants/2026/02/02/chicago-black-restaurant-week-restaurant-list).

## Top Cop Endorses COPA Investigation Authority

Police Superintendent Larry Snelling said Thursday he [supports giving COPA authority](https://news.wttw.com/2026/02/06/top-cop-copa-should-probe-chicago-police-conduct-during-immigration-raids-because-no-one) to investigate whether CPD officers violated the Welcoming City Ordinance by assisting federal immigration agents—because, he said, no one would "trust" probes conducted by internal affairs.

"There should be an outside body doing that work," Snelling told the joint session of the Immigrant and Refugee Rights and Police and Fire Committees.

COPA's chief administrator LaKenya White has said her office is prepared to investigate [40 complaints](https://news.wttw.com/2026/02/02/alderpeople-say-copa-should-investigate-chicago-police-conduct-during-immigration-raids) filed against CPD over its interactions with federal agents since June. The proposal goes before the full City Council on **February 18**.

## Archer Avenue Standoff Continues

The Archer Avenue Complete Streets project in Brighton Park remains a flashpoint as construction nears completion. The redesign—part of the city's response to a corridor that saw [14 traffic deaths and 1,426 injuries](https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/06/18/bike-lanes-other-safety-upgrades-coming-to-archer-kedzie-in-brighton-park-after-years-of-crashes/) from 2019-2023—includes protected bike lanes, pedestrian refuge islands, and curb extensions.

But opposition has been fierce. A [South Side Weekly profile](https://southsideweekly.com/archer-ave-bike-lanes-tension-fuels-political-ambitions/) published this week details how the controversy has become intertwined with local political ambitions. Former School Board candidate Eva Villalobos has emerged as a visible organizer of rallies opposing the project, framing it as decisions "forced" onto the community.

The safety case is stark: Archer and Kedzie Avenues together accounted for **57 percent** of all serious traffic injuries or fatalities to pedestrians and cyclists in Brighton Park last year. But navigating the tension between safety data and community sentiment remains the harder problem.

## Federal Funding Freeze Looms

Meanwhile, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy's order halting new federal grants for bike infrastructure continues to cast a shadow over future Chicago projects. [CBS Chicago reports](https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/possible-federal-bike-lane-expansion-chicago/) that projects already under construction have their funding secured, but anything not yet obligated is now under review.

Chicago has 478 miles of bike network—including buffered, protected, and neighborhood greenway segments. What happens next depends on how strictly the administration enforces its new priorities.

# Lead

## Small Business Wins $1.67M in Lead Line Contracts

Mayor Johnson's administration [announced last month](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2026/january/lead-service-replacement-contracts.html) that four inaugural Lead Service Line Replacement Small Business Initiative contracts—totaling over $1.67 million—have been awarded to three small, minority- and women-owned construction firms.

The contracts represent more than a spending announcement. The city made several adjustments to make the work accessible:

- **Reduced bonding**: Set at 33.3% of total bid (down from the typical 100%)
- **Divided scopes**: Larger projects split into smaller contract opportunities
- **Expanded NAICS codes**: More specialty areas now eligible for subcontracting

Additional water and sewer projects are expected to be advertised in Q1 2026.

The scale of the challenge remains immense: Chicago has nearly 400,000 lead service lines, with full replacement not expected until 2076—30 years past the federal deadline.
